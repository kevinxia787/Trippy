# What's Trippy?
Trippy is a mobile application that aims to help travelers streamline their travel planning process by allowing them to dynamically pick locations to go to during their trip. It gives them total control on where to go, and curates a list of different places of interest, divied by categories such as food, drink, sights, arts, and so on. 

# How to Run

2. run npm install
3. Open a terminal tab and run "node server.js"
4. Open another terminal tab, navigate to the frontend directory, and run "npm start"
